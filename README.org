* This contains BOTH my old vimrc and nvim directory
- As neovim now follows XDG_CONFIG guidelines, which your boi loves.
- Don't get it twisted though, there is barely anything in here, if you want to see real power, may I refer you to my DOOM Emacs' config files

* How can I use this?
** Step 1: Clone to XDG_CONFIG complient area
#+begin_src bash
cd $HOME
cd .config
git clone https://github.com/loudrxiv/nvim.git
#+end_src
** Step 2: Install some plugin mananger & decide on init.vim vs. init.lua
#+begin_src bash
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
touch ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
#+end_src
** Step 3: Customize init.vim
